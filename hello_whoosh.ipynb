      "42455_0.txt 36.0 If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film  there is a problem. br /  br / Just like everyone else  when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role  I was a bit confused. His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe  they  know some things I don t about 007  maybe I ve been missing something about the character. Plus the hype around the production was excellent the rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that  as a long as you know what you re doing. br /  br / But at the very first frame of the film my original skepticism re-emerged  br /  br / The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance  chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around  aiming his gun at the camera  taking the classic pose. Right then  I couldn t help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background    and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting    I am your NEW James Bond  .  Not yet gentlemen  did I think. br /  br / Still  let s give them a second chance  here comes the long-awaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slow-motion turning into flying hearts spades clubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing  where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes  Where are the girls  Gone     Why       At this point  I feared the worst  did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond    br /  br / But here comes hope James Bond chases a man through a building site climbing on cranes  jumping and falling hard. Great  this might not be a real James Bond flick  but at least  we re in for some good entertainment. Right  br /  br / Wrong  The rest of the film is nothing but a long  two and a half hours long  demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character. br /  br / No Monneypenny no  Q  no  R   and every time  M   Judi Drench  appears on the screen  the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he s doing and come back to his senses. Yet all I could hear from her was   What have you done to James Bond  Who are you  blond man   Why don t you ever smile  Why don t you ever say anything witty  How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone  How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes  How could you fall in love with such a boring girl  What do you want from us  Bring us back England s most precious hero   br /  br / The other characters barely exist  The villain  named Le Chiffre  is a card player who s task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat   no. Why  He might be a villain  but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating  We know he s the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knows maybe someday we ll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary. br /  br / Then I thought   I get it  His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player s cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl  in the background  who s eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision  Great  . Was I right   Of course not  that would be something you d see in a James Bond film... br /  br / But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond film  br /  br / James Bond  let s keep using this name  for the lack of a better one  is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement  he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat  letting 007 s  genitals  dangling from underneath  Yes you heard right . Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty s favorite secret agent s nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape  Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer  No  he passes out and wakes up in a hospital. br /  br / The torture may have stopped for Bond  but increases for me  Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper  yes  girlfriend  who tells him  to rebuild his pride  that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger  she would still love him. To which  the emasculated James Bond replies  watch out  humor coming your way    That s because you know what I can do with my little finger.  Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this never-ending-going-nowhere-story   And don t we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens  the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals  br /  br / There were other problems with the film of course such as the boring story  and the fact that the casino  which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film  turned out to be so poorly exploited. br /  br / Giving this film one star might not be fair  do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating   but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong  spirit  and doesn t take in consideration that  unlike other movies  James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers  and that this rare fact deserves to be honored. br /  br / Don t mess with MY James Bond.\n",
      "3538_10.txt 35.0 The goal of any James Bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy  step into the shoes of Agent 007.  FRWL  comes closer to this goal than any other game  because this time you control the real James Bond. No offense to Pierce Brosnan  who made a fantastic Bond and loaned his voice and likeness to  EON   but Sean Connery was the original James Bond  and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool. br /  br / I must say at this point  like many others who have reviewed this game  that Sean 70 year old voice doesn t fit his 30 year old image on screen  and this takes some getting used to  but it s certainly worth it. He makes lines like  Bond  James Bond  and  Shaken  not stirred  into a big deal again. But controlling Sir Sean as he takes on the evil organization known as OCTOPUS is  as Bond said in  Octopussy    only the tip of the tentacle.  The awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. It s the original gun barrel from the movies. Then you take on first mission  rescuing the Prime Minister s hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at Parliament  and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro. The world of the game is truly the world of the original James Bond  right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the James Bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game  as Bond infiltrates a secret factory. br /  br / After the game s opening  the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie  FRWL.  James Bond is sent to Turkey to retrieve a Lektor device from a Russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him. In Turkey  Bond teams up with lovable sidekick Kerim Bey. Bond must retrieve the device  protect the damsel in distress  and get both safely back to London. Bond screenwriter Bruce Feirstein worked on the script  and he s done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie. The characters from the movie are all recreated well  but some are better than others. The impersonators voicing villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are uncanny. And there s a moment early on in the game where you interact with a Miss Moneypenny  M  and Q who all look and behave as they did in the original Sean Connery 007 movies. br /  br / What puts this game miles ahead of the other Bond games  besides Sir Sean s voice and likeness  is two notable features in the game play. One is Bond focus. While you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other  an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots Bond would shoot at  such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death. The other notable feature is the stealth and m l e kills. When you re in close enough range  just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only Sean Connery s James Bond displayed. br /  br / Sean Connery s Bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent  so you only have a few gadgets  but they re good ones. The Q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas Bond can t reach  like the Q-spider in  EON   only better. The classic laser watch is useful  not just for getting into sealed rooms  but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available. Sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with  but you must experience them for yourself. Besides the gadgets  you can go dress Bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game  including the gray suit from the movie  the standard black tuxedo  a retro stealth suit  and that classic white tuxedo  all which look exactly like they did when Sir Sean wore them in the movies. When you drive in the game  you drive the Aston Martin DB5 straight out of  Goldfinger.  It can t turn invisible  but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie. And when you re not flying down the streets of Istanbul in the  Goldinger  car  you can fly through the air in the  Thunderball  jet pack. br /  br / Then there s the multi-player. Of course  it has to be compared to the standard of the  GoldenEye  game  and it fails. Also  you can only play Bond villains rather than Bond himself or the other heroes of the game. But the multi-player is amusing  and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing. The basic game does have other flaws. Some of the movie s most exciting moments  particularly the gypsy camp shootout  Bond s brawl with Red Grant on the Orient Express  and a confrontation between Bond and Rosa Klebb s bladed shoe  aren t done justice in game form. And the game is a fast play  even on the hardest difficulty. But overall  this game is the best James Bond experience so far.\n",
      "8522_8.txt 29.0 You don t review James Bond movies  you evaluate them  rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect  even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn t. So  here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography  the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway  here s how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10   br /  br / Title  NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN  The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline  but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery s vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case  it is a catchy title. 8 points. br /  br / Pre-Credit Teaser  Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films  there is no Teaser  the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing  yet another  oh-no  Bond has been killed  fakeout. 4 points. br /  br / Opening Credits  Other than a screen full of tiny 007 s  they didn t even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points. br /  br / Theme Song  As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall  Never Say Never Again  would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme  it s merely okay. 6 points. br /  br /  Bond  James Bond   Appropriately  since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade s hiatus  the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily  Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer  sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee  he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all  it is one of Connery s best  and most relaxed  turns as the character. 9 points. br /  br / Bond Babes  Even in the best of the Bond films  the female characters aren t given much dimension  they exist largely as necessary props for Bond s use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she s not bad to look at either. 8 points. br /  br / Bond Villain  The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated  Blofeld is back -- at least  for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain  Max von Sydow isn t given a lot to do in the role  but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains  it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle  yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy  ruthless without seeming cartoonish  his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond s best villains. 10 points. br /  br / Bond Baddies  Fatima Blush  What can I say  As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen  Barbara Carrera breezes through the film  displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales  most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular  even by Bondian standards. 10 points. br /  br / Sinister Plot  As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL  the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that  nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don t pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons  this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks  the film succeeds on its own. 9 points. br /  br / Production values  The film starts out with an uneasy style  like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress  the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose  making it a superior adventure. 8 points.  br /  br / Bonus Points  There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged  as played by Edward Fox   M  is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the  Double Os   a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part  and  Q  suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film  such as replacing Bond s Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback  an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK  which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points. br /  br / Summary  NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas  it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery  villain Brandauer  assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details  as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits  theme song and such seem  the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film  a very good substitute  but a substitute nonetheless. br /  br / Bond-o-meter Rating  78 points out of 100.\n",
      "8519_8.txt 25.0  Empire Strikes Back  director Irvin Kershner s  Never Say Never Again   a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie  Thunderball   doesn t surpasses the Terence Young original  but this non-Harry Saltzman   Albert R. Broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. Nevertheless  despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score   Never Say Never Again  rates as an above-average  suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including Sean Connery  Kim Basinger  Klaus Maria Brandauer  Max Von Sydow  Barbara Carrera  Edward Fox  Bernie Casey  Alec McCowen  and Rowan Atkinson. The film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. Unlike the franchise James Bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle   Never Say Never Again  provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. Indeed  the film features only three gadgets  an explosive ball-point pen  a wristwatch with a laser  and a souped-up motorcycle. Aside from the flavorful Lani Hall opening theme song   Ice Station Zebra  composer Michel Legrand s orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. Legrand replicates none of those snappy  jazz cues that made John Barry s music for the regular Bond franchise so memorable. All in all   Never Say Never Again  seems to fit more into the first two Bond movies  Dr. No  and  From Russia With Love  and  On Her Majesty s Secret Service  in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter. br /  br /  Never Say Never Again  presents Sean Connery s James Bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach. Ironically  Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore s Bond movies treated 007 as an active  young guy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple screenplay that emphasize Bond s age. Initially  Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece  but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and Connery sports a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into  Diamonds Are Forever  at the last moment to replace John Gavin. Connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for  Diamonds Are Forever.  At 52  Connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script. br /  br / The action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman  only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn t looking. It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M  Edward Fox of  Day of the Jackal   to test Bond s ability. The new M doesn t share his predecessor s use of field agents. M decides that Bond needs to clean out his system of all  free radicals  and has 007 packed off to Shrublands. While at the country clinic  Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them. The nurse is none other than SPECTRE assassin Fatima Blush  Barbara Carrera of  The Island of Dr. Moreau   and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees USAF officer Jack Petachi  Gavan O Herlihy of  Superman 3  . Petachi is part of a SPECTRE plan by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo  Klaus Maria Brandauer of  Out of Africa   to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a duplicate eyeball into Captain Petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. After he steals the weapons for SPECTRE  Fatima Blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up. Indeed  the first part of  Never Say Never Again   apart from the SPECTRE planning conference  belong to Fatima as she supervises Petachi s stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond  one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device. br /  br / Eventually  Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino  Kim Basinger of  Mother Lode   and sneaks into Largo s charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called  Domination  to see who will rule the world. Bond bests him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems to be able to remove. Bond and Fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up. Their earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. Like in the original  Thunderball   the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea  but just the warheads themselves. br /  br / Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison  Nigel Small-Fawcett  no lesser than Rowan Atkinson of  Mr. Bean  fame  who is worried that Bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise. Of course  Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the film s source of comic relief. The C.I.A. sends Felix Leiter  Bernie Casey of  Guns of the Magnificent Seven   to back up Bond. This is the first time that an African-American portrayed Leiter. Bond encounters his share of problems  involving saving Domino from Arab slavers  while Leiter and he save the world.  Never Say Never Again  is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many neat touches  but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise Bond films have. Indeed   Never Say Never Again  looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theatre take on 007.\n",

It s not Bond. There s senseless killing  no Bond-babe  no one-liners  no great end-scene  no gadgets  no suspense  no story... br /  br / RATING if this was any action movie   3/10. br /  br / RATING  for being a Bond-movie   1/10. br /  br / I m sad I actually paid to see this as it might encourage the producers to make another movie like this one. br /  br / BOND IS DEAD. I hope they won t make another movie like this and call it Bond. br /  br /     EDIT     JB  Had a yerning Monneypenny. CR  Has money. br /  br / And to all the people complaining that  this IS the REAL Bond  straight from the novels  . Ahem.. this may be the Bond from the novel but it s not the Bond that s been in movies for the past decades. That s the Bond we ve expected to see. That s the Bond we want to see. br /  br / If they really want another character. Fine. But give it another name. 008 or whatever.\n",
      "42450_0.txt 24.0 OK  this is the 21st century. So  maybe it s time for even the Bond genre to get a tune-up for new generation audiences. At least that s what the producers thought. br /  br / But the New Bond is as disappointing as New Coke. Nothing beats the original. br /  br / For starters  the producers seemed to make sure to keep everything out of the screenplay for  Casino Royale  that made the Bond series unique  exciting  engaging and fun. br /  br / The so-called  Bond formula  balanced sadism with sensuality  and ironic humor. Sadly missing from this film too are the other Bond staples  gadgets  buxom blonds  and wonderful little quips and double entendres. This all gave the Bond series a comic book adventure cadence and buoyancy. It didn t take itself too seriously. br /  br / But  Casino Royale  jettisons all this and just keeps slogging along with relentless action scenes  brutality  banality and not much else. Yes  the action scenes are astutely choreographed  filmed and edited. But they are needed to shore up a saggy  dragged-out and somewhat convoluted plot. br /  br / The opening immediately warns you that this is not  classic  Bond. It sets the film s heavy tone. Bond brutally assassinates two criminals  one by drowning in a lavatory sink  in black-and-white film noir  no less. By contrast in the  Goldfinger   1964  prequel  Bond blows up a narcotics operation  changes into a tux  romances a cabaret dancer  and easily dispenses with an assassin  all the before the opening credits. br /  br / The opening credits of  Casino Royale  alone are another warning. There is not one stylized silhouette of a female model  which was the glamour signature in almost all Bond films. Instead  we just have silhouettes of guy shooting each other and bleeding in Technicolor across the screen. Yuck   br /  br / What s horribly pretentious is that the whole film tries to chronicle the apprentice Bond s transition into a 007 assassin. But it s as contrived and unconvincing as Anakin Skywalker s metamorphosis into Darth Vader. And  in the end it s even sappier than the brief marriage of George Lanzenby s Bond to Dianna Rigg in the 1969  on Her Majesty s Secret Service.   br /  br / Frankly  I m not Bond s psychologist and so I really don t care to delve into life s little traumas that shaped 007. I m content with accepting that he just grew up that way. br /  br / Daniel Craig is terribly miscast as Bond. He s a blue collar Bond. He looks self-conscious in a tuxedo. He s too hard chiseled in appearance for the debonair Bond as invented by Ian Flemming. br /  br / Craig could have just as easily been cast as one of the villains in the film. His strident  driven demeanor reminds me a little bit of Donovan Grant  the SPECTRE assassin played by Robert Shaw in the 1963  From Russia with Love.  Craig is humorless  and too much on the edge for my tastes. Actually  his squinty eyes  big upper torso  and gait reminds me a little of Popeye the Sailor. br /  br / Like the Timothy Dalton Bond  he has no sense of playfulness either. His romantic side seems forced in the film s few dull and gratuitous lovemaking scenes. And  the women cast to play opposite him in this film can barely gain admission into the sorority of Bond babes. br /  br / Equally lackluster is Mads Mikkelsen s portrayal of high-roller Le Chiffre. He doesn t fit into the shoes of previous legendary bond villains such as Goldfinger  Largo  and Blofeld. Frankly  Mikkelsen is just plain creepy  but not scary. As the top bad guy he seems to be on Valium most of the time. br /  br / The silly torture scene at the end is also out of character for him. Mikkelsen doesn t have any of the bully  bluster and swagger of the classic Bond villains. Please give me just one script line like Goldfinger s   I expect you to die Mr. Bond   Ho hum. br /  br / All of this makes for just another forgetful spy movie with lots of fists and blood and guts  nothing more. It s wrapped itself in the James Bond mystique   which will guarantee a good box office   but pays no homage to the genre. br /  br / It s too bad the creators felt they hand to change such a celebrated formula that has sustained the popularity of Bond series for nearly four decades.\n",
      "8518_7.txt 23.0 1983 was  the battle of the Bonds . That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film  the former  Octopussy  was produced by the  official  makers of the Bond films while the later  Never Say Never Again  was produced  unofficially  by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the  unofficial  film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. br /  br / Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery  returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971 s Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love  just a few years older. Connery s delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery s age is his believability  especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let s face it even Connery  despite being in top physical shape  looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue  Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances. br /  br / Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by Claudine Auger. br /  br / Then there s the villain  Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer s Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be  suave  charming  evil and above all believable none the less. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007. br /  br / The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow a nice appearance as Blofeld  though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond s bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox s M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee  Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen s wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. br /  br / On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase  this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models  explosions  and all the things we expect from a Bond film. Irvin Kershner  then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back  brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles. br /  br / Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980 s computer sand video games. While technology dates any film after a time  this film s heavy reliance on it  especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it s a remake of Thunderball. br /  br / Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script sports good dialogue scenes  not a single cringe worthy one liner  how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about    some humorous situations  and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it s a remake  there s quite a lot of good things in the script for the film. br /  br / Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the  unofficial  status of the film  the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately Michael Legrand s score is far from adequate. Legrand s score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond film. br /  br / Despite being heavily dated  somewhat predicable  and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film. With one of the best casts of any Bond film  good action sequences  good special effects  good direction  and some terrific dialogue  this film proves that  unofficial  isn t a bad thing. In fact it is is better then Octopussy and the winner of  the battle of the Bonds .\n",
      "42442_0.txt 21.0 I totally disliked this film  because it just went ahead and threw the James Bond of lore out the window. The suave  sophisticated   witty super agent is gone. I d rather not offend Mr Craig  but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it s not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him. I feel that if Mr Flemming or Mr. Broccoli were alive  they would not approve of the casting or even the spirit of this film. The film isn t terrible in a movie sense  but it doesn t fit as a James Bond film. James Bond has been well established in the cinema. Here James Bond has been reestablished as something else. You can either accept or reject it. I m only 21  but even I will not accept this reinvention of Bond for a new audience or generation. I first discovered Bond as a child in awe of the magic of the films of old.I consumed them all  cheered for Bond and indulged in these adventures. Sadly that magic has faded  and boring realism and drama has taken the forefront in an attempt to reinvent Bond  though it may have been acceptable if the Bond was right and if the Bond spirit was still in tact. The attempt at believability was destroyed by an unbelievable James Bond  the original foundation is too great. Connery  Lazenby  Moore  Dalton   Brosnan were all good acceptable James Bonds. Even Niven in the original Casino Royale  bond spoof was acceptable. They were all debonair gents. Craig doesn t portray that and he doesn t look or act right. I d argue that Craig would be a good Villain in a Bond film.\n",
      "8510_8.txt 20.0 I m sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes  that movie s influence is unmistakable  but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of Psycho. While it s true that the opening theme of the twelfth  and Connery s last  Bond film is one of the worst of the entire series  the film itself still manages to stand on its own  despite many other weaknesses. Besides that  even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film. br /  br / Sure  Sean Connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed  at least by James Bond standards   but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment  having spent most of recent time teaching  not doing  and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from M that he pay more attention to his health  dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot. Besides  this is James Bond  remember  This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human  and all of his fans are getting all upset because he s got some gray hairs. When this guy retires at the end of the film  M sends poor  Small-Fawcett   in a hilarious cameo from Rowan Atkinson  to tell Bond that without him  he worries about the safety of the free world  and all of you people can t get over the fact that he s not a sprightly young man anymore. Come on  Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond just as good as he ever could  or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to. br /  br / The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage  as Dr. Evil would say   Oh hell  let s just do what we always do     so there s clearly not much new there  but this is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners. There s the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample    If you could just fill this beaker for me    From here   There are a lot of good one-liners  but the sexual innuendos aimed at Mr. Bond are especially prevalent in this installment. But then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain s face  making him scream as if his face were burning off. Not a very good attempt at comic relief  especially since this guy had been kicking Bond s ass with some sort of super-spring device that could cut through pretty much anything. And of course  Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls of the entire series. br /  br / It s no secret that Never Say Never Again has dated badly  and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects   with the one exception of the flying missiles  which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect  and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie  second only to those damn sharks. Evidently  Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks  granted  they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own   in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line   I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN  laser beams attached to their heads   And then  of course  there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons  and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one-liner from James. br /  br / The domination video game created by Largo  the film s villain  is an especially memorable scene  and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series  far to superior to the laughable one in Tomorrow Never Dies . But despite many strengths  the film s weaknesses are left clearer in the audience s mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion  one of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball  and inferiorly recreated . Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond as he left him in the tower alive  Dr. Evil s brilliance  once again   I ll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan. What     the climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere.  br /  br / All in all  Never Say Never Again ranks very highly on the James Bond scale  and Connery s wink at the end of the film  as well as the two closing lines  suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as Bond. Clearly  this is no longer very likely  so we can only hope.\n",
      "7456_10.txt 20.0 Don t get me wrong.  GoldenEye  was revolutionary and is definitely the best FPS game to be based on the 007 franchise. But the series had fallen into a FPS rut. Enter  Everything or Nothing   which puts Bond in third-person. When I wrote my earlier review for  From Russia With Love   I had finished FRWL and just started EON and judged EON a bit harshly. Even though FRWL definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise  EON definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. Missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an SUV  driving an Aston Martin  driving a limousine that is wired to explode  commandeering two different types of tanks a la  GoldenEye   riding a motorcycle  flying a helicopter  repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires  and free falling after a plummeting damsel. Sure  vehicle controls are a little clumsy  but the issue here is the variety. br /  br / As movie adaptations   GoldenEye  and FRWL were all that I could have hoped for. But EON s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a James Bond adventure. This is helped by the impressive cast list of Willem DeFoe  Shannon Elizabeth  Heidi Klum  and Misaki Ito. Judi Dench and John Cleese reprise their movie roles of M and Q  respectively  and Pierce Brosnan  while no Sean Connery  adds credibility to the game s proceedings. All characters resemble the stars  with the disappointing exception of Heidi Klum  who s in-game model doesn t do the real-life model justice. Mya s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen Bond title tunes. br /  br / The game also plays tribute to some of the older Bond movies. Willem DeFoe s character is a former colleague of Christopher Walken s baddie from  A View to a Kill . Richard Kiel appears as Jaws  the hulking henchman from  The Spy Who Loved Me  and  Moonraker  in three fight scenes  the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have. br /  br / Single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as Bond. Like Bond  you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. The game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth  with plenty of wall and object cover. Unfortunately  unlike FRWL  only one button in EON controls both crouching and wall clinging  so Bond may end up crouching low when he s supposed to be peeking around a corner  and vice-versa. The game also allows players to go into  Bond reflex  mode. While you browse your inventory  everything around you will go into super slo-mo  allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. While this takes some getting used to  eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular  Bond moments   such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath  and greatly add to the Bond movie feeling. br /  br / There are 3 available difficulty levels  Operative  Agent  and Double Oh. On Operative  you can breeze through in a few hours. On Agent  a few weeks. On Double Oh  a few months. The difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. Garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the Bond girls wear. Some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints  but when all is said and done  no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a Bond movie. br /  br / Multi-player  unfortunately  is not as thrilling.  GoldenEye  still has the best multi-player mode of any Bond game. EON s main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser MI6 agents on a less important mission than Bond s. A more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. But the single-player mode is the most complete Bond experience to date. The ending  as with most Bond games  is anticlimactic. While the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game  the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. Also  levels that require Bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. Still  for any serious Bond fan  not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the Bond films.\n"
